# WaitingAndChilling
A SCL SL plugin that spawns players in a lobby during the Waiting For Players phase of the round.

Players are spawned in a lobby as tutorials. This is just to entertain people while waiting for other players.

# Configs

`wac_enabled` Enables the plugin. Default to true.

`wac_giveItems` Give players guns in the lobby. (Best when `admintoolbox_tutorial_dmg_allowed` is disabled in the AdminToolBox plugin.)

If you want to change the location of the lobby:

`wac_coordinate_x` Defaults to 53

`wac_coordinate_y` Defaults to 1020

`wac_coordinate_z` Defaults to -43

# Installation

Place the .dll file into you sm_plugins folder and restart your server.
